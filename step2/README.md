# Step 2: Design Workflow

## Workflow Definition:
1. Initialize the inotify monitor.
2. Add a watch to a directory for specific events.
3. Wait for events using a loop.
4. Parse the events and log them with timestamps.

## Directory to monitor:
- `/tmp` used for initial testing.

## Programming Considerations:
- Handle errors gracefully.
- Make the code modular for future expansions.
